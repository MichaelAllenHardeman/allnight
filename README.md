# AllNight

A chrome extension for creating twitch.tv playlists. Written using AngularJS.

### Disclaimer

This repo is unfinished and probably doesn't function very well anymore. I never updated it, and I'm sure twitch's api
has changed significantly.

### Installation

 1. Open the extensions configuration page in Chrome

     ![Extensions](images/readme/extensions.png)
